# Part#1
Please do Part 2 and Part 3 of http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Intro_IRC_Activity:
- Installing and starting an IRC client is done.
- I joined and observed channels discussions for few days. In the IRC channels I observed, there was not a single person leading the conversations; it was a mix of one-to-many and one-to-one. Basically, people discussed the progress of their work and any issues that they might have. The conversations was pretty much informal and related to their open source projects.    


# Part#2
Please do Part1, Part 2 and Part 4 of http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Getting_connected_with_the_community - For part 1 you can use the same channel as part 3 of the above exercise.
- PART 1 - IRC: I used  /join #chooseYourOwnChannel and /server irc.freenode.net
- PART 2 - Titanpad : https://titanpad.com/ChooseYourPage
- PART 4 - Discussions:
* Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.
 1. synchronous your code sends a message, calls a function etc. and is blocked until an answer, a return value etc. arrives.
 2. asynchronous your code continues executing after sending a message/calling a function, you usually pass a reference to a callback function that executes when the answer arrives (can happen in an hour, couple of days, years), your main thread continue in the meantime.

* Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.
 Human–computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing the interaction between people and computers and the construction of interfaces to afford this. Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface which includes both software and hardware. Interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface – for better or worse. Because it deals with people as well as computers, as a knowledge area HCI draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions including psychology, computer science, product design, anthropology and engineering. 

* Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.
 1. Group Collaboration Software Decreases Efficiency: The reason is simple: Many tasks are done more productively outside the group-ware than inside it. The calendar example about the disadvantages of group collaboration software shows why--it takes a lot of time to synchronize the schedules of the participants; and when there is a change in the schedule of one person, this can lead to quite a lot of turmoil for the rest. 
 2. Unreliability: Another Disadvantage of Group Collaboration Software: When the server with your groupware is down, nobody can work unless they do so separately, which certainly isn't the idea behind groupware. 
 3. Groupware Costs a Lot: Groupware isn't cheap. When you add its price and the other costs you need to make in order to deploy and maintain it and you draw the line, the result could be pretty shocking.  
 4. Group Software Allows No Non-Verbal Communication: Any communication medium that doesn't provide for the use of non-verbal communication, such as facial expressions, gestures, etc., makes business communication more difficult and misunderstandings more common.

* Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.
 1. Older adults: There are different problems they encounter when dealing with technology: financial limitations, ignorance about how to use it, feeling of fear to “break” it, health difficulties.
 2. Cognitive disabilities: the a person with a cognitive disability has greater difficulty with one or more types or mental tasks than an average person. 
 3. Software usability: Ideally, all software should be easy to use and accessible for a wide range of users. But reality shows that applications and web sites, from large-scale companies to smaller ones, often fall short of the most basic usability and accessibility goals.



# Part 3: 
Please use class slack channel to do this http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Open_Source_Communication_Activity. You do not need to observe it for 7 days, just fill out the directions section.

- Name: RCOS
- Website:  slack.com
- Description: Open Source Class
- Project Goal: Learn about open source software.
- Communication Modes: website

Reflection: RCOS is a group of RPI students who work on open source projects. Members work on a variety of projects. RCOS provides a creative, intellectual and entrepreneurial outlet for students to use the latest open-source software platforms to develop applications that solve societal problems.


# Part 4: 
Please do first three items under directions and do item 2 under deliverables. http://foss2serve.org/index.php/StyleGuides (Watch the videos then write a response to them).
### Directions:
- This article talks about the need for a coding standard: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/25/why-coding-style-matters/

RESPOSE: Nicholas wrote a great article about coding style standard. I learned from his article that simple problems can look harder if bad code style is used. His article makes me realize that developing a good coding a style will help me understand my code when I look at it years after I write it. Also, Nicholas indicated that having a good coding style may extend the life span of the code. He illustrates this by telling a personal story:
"I recently received an email from someone who is working on code that I wrote 10 years ago. Apparently, much to my shock and horror, my code is still being used in the product. He felt compelled to email me to say that he enjoyed working with my code. I smiled. My future teammate actually did appreciate the coding style I followed."
Now, I am considering to use of the tools he recommended to help me enforce a coding style.

- In this video, Crockford uses JavaScript to illustrate key ideas about programming style https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EANG8ZZbRs.
RESPONSE: Douglas Crockford, the person who “discovered” JSON in 2001, gave a talk about coding style.  He used JavaScript to show what a good coding style is, but the principles he talks about can be used in any programming language. Here is a summary of his talk:

- A good style can help produce better programs. 
- Style should not be about personal personal preference and self-expression.
- Programs must communicate clearly to people.
- Programs must communicate clearly to people
- Use a space after a comma, not before.
- Use spacces to disambiguate parens.
- use one space between a function name and a parameter list.
- If there is a feature of a language that is sometimes problematic, and if it can be replaced with another feature that is more reliable, then always use the more reliable feature.
- Make your programs look like what they do.
- Global variables are evil. Avoid global variables whenever you can.
- When using global variables, be explicit by naming it with uppercase separated by underscore.
- The ++ operator is confusing and shouldn't be used. Use x += 1 instead.
- For no cost, by adopting a more rigorous style, many classes of errors can be automatically avoided.
- Programming is the most complicated thing that humans do since computers programs must be perfect and humans are not good at perfect.
- Designing a programming style demands discipline. It is not selecting features because they liked, or pretty, or familiar.
- There will be bugs but do what you can to move the odds to your favor.
