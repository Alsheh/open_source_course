###2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

If a licese is not declared, the project is automatically under a copyright which is the default state of any code without a license. However, this may no be the intention of the authors. The authours may indend to make the project open source so that maximum number of people could benfit from the project. Therefor, it important to choose an open source license that suits the nature of the projectand tells the users explicitly what their rights to the software are.

###3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project that doesn't have a declared license cannot be used, modified, and shared. "The absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend" (Github.com, 2016). For the aforementioned reasons, using a project that doens't have an explicit licnese doesn't allow end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code. 


###4 Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.
I agree with this claim. The Web provides the authors more control over their content by allowing them include embeded hyperlinks in their content. This makes it more convenient for Internet exploration. Additionally, Gopher failed to be open during the development phase for the protocol. Therefore, Gopher had less human resources to help improve the protocol. On the other hand, "the Web's technology was also quickly opened up to the larger development community". The open-source development model enabled teh Web to become more popular since necessary fixes/changes were made quickly by the large development community. 



###5 Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
Linux uses the GPL v2 license which was created in 1991. This license ensures that users of Linux have the ability to customize it however they want and share the modified versions with others without being liable or violating any copyright laws. Also, since there are many Linux contributors, it is not possible to change the license to a more modern verion of the same license or a different license because this requires every Linux contributor to agree on the terms of the new license which is almost impossible due to the large number of contrubutors. 

###6 Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
There are two projects I am considering right now. First, Chrome plug in that enables users to browse the web using the keyboard. The second project is Raspberry Pi project. I plan to to use a rasberry pi as VPN router and a server storage. The license I will choese for these two projects are the Apache-2.0 license. 


###7. GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD:
For a developer, the use of any of the three licenses, GPL-3, LGPL, and Apache-2.0 seem like a good option. Depending on the goals of the developer s/he can pick the most appropriate license for his project. For example, if the develper wish to make modifications to the software and decides to keep the modified version non-free, the Apache-2.0 allows him to do that. On the other hand, if the developer wants to ensure any modified version of his software stay free software, the GPL and LGPL licenses are the appropriate options for his project. 
The Apache License 2.0 (Apache-20) seems a good option for a company. Unlike the GPL-3 licensse, the Apache-2.0 allows the compancy to place wrranty on its licensed software. Thie gives the company's cutomers more confidence in the in the software which makes this license more benegicial to the company using this kind of license. Also, this Apache-2.0 license allows sublicensing which can be profitable to the company holding this license. 
For the common good, the use of both the GPL-3.0 and LGP-3.0 ensures that the the licesed project will stay in the public domain since any derivatives works can only be redistributed under the GPL/LGPL license.

###9 Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.

I metioned that I have two project ideas that I am considering to work on. The first one a Chrome plug in that allows users to browse the internent using the keyboard. This tool might make the users more productive and the end users of this tool would be people who use the keyboard on daily basis and feel more comfortable using a keyboard such as programmers, writers, etc. I am still looking for other tools that allow moseless borwsing and if I find the one tool that meets my needs I might consider to contribute to that project instead of making my own. 

The second project that I am thinking about is to use a rasberry pi as VPN router and a server storage. Ideally, I'd like to make a user-friendly interface to use a raberry pi as VPN router and a server storage and make the set up process straight forward to end users who do not have suffcient technical knowledge. 

The license I plan to use for both of these projects is the Apache-2.0 license.


###10. Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects - create a table which project has which license. for example:

| Website | License Present | License |
| ------- | :---------------: | -------: |
|https://github.com/wtg/shuttle_tracking_2 | Yes| MIT License |
|https://github.com/Behemyth/Soul-Engine| Yes | GPL-3.0 |
|https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty | Yes | BSD License |
|https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon| Yes| MIT License|
|https://github.com/TheoBr/Chrometana| Yes | MIT License|
