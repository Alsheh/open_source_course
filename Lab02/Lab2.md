###2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

If a licese is not declared, the project is automatically under a copyright which is the default state of any code without a license. However, this may no be the intention of the authors. The authours may indend to make the project open source so that maximum number of people could benfit from the project. Therefor, it important to choose an open source license that suits the nature of the projectand tells the users explicitly what their rights to the software are.

###3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

A project that doesn't have a declared license cannot be used, modified, and shared. "The absence of a license means that default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend" (Github.com, 2016). For the aforementioned reasons, using a project that doens't have an explicit licnese doesn't allow end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code.


###10. Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects - create a table which project has which license. for example:


| Website | License Present | License |
| ------- | :---------------: | -------: |
|https://github.com/wtg/shuttle_tracking_2 | Yes| MIT License |
|https://github.com/Behemyth/Soul-Engine| Yes | GPL-3.0 |
|https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty | Yes | BSD License |
|https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon| Yes| MIT License|
|https://github.com/TheoBr/Chrometana| Yes | MIT License|
